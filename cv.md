## About myself

My first steps and interest in programming began and strengthened at school and university, but because of the responsibility to other duties, I could not plunge into it with my head. After graduating from university, I am working out as a website editor, and every day I spend learning something new.
I hope that my aspiration and perseverance will help me achieve my goals and become a professional specialist.

## My skills

- HTML, CSS, SCSS
- Git
- JavaScript
- React

## Code example

**Array.diff (from codewars):**
_Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result. It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order. If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other._

```javascript
function arrayDiff(a, b) {
  return a.filter(el => !b.includes(el));
}
```
